# About Me
My name is Ati and I have been working as a technical writer for more than 10 years. I started my career as a writer and editor many years ago and then I changed it to a copywriter and finally here I am, a technical writer. My love of writing and technology pushed me in this path and I enjoy every moment of it. My main expertise is software technical writing. I have written many software documentation such as API documentation, user manuals, user guides, and so on.
In my years of working, I have learned success never comes by chance but it is a long patience and intense learning. So, based on that I have made my career very challenging and engaging for myself in order to fulfil my dreams.
