# Welcome
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/welcome_ati.jpeg">

In this portfolio, I have tried to show you my last experiences in different fields such as developers' documentations, user manual, user guide, published articles, API documentation and etc.
In the first section, you can see one simple example of API documentation in eDreams company. In the mentioned section, I have written introduction, authentication, error definitions and also sample hotel API.

In the next section, you can see various documentation such as documenting Json/xml, user guide, Quickstart, developer's guide, 2 samples of published article, glossary. All these documents refer to my last company where I was working for 6 years.

In the last section, I have mentioned one sample of Swagger. The only reason for writing that sample was that I wanted to show that I am familiar with Swagger Editor, SwaggerHub, and Swagger UI.
