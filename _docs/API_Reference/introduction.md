# Introduction to Hotel API
This API is a part of last project designed in eDreams company. The mentioned API was designed for two types of customers: business owners (B2B) and passengers (B2C). In B2B, the third party businesses could connect to our data and by accessing to our API, they were able to upload the data to their websites and also changed the data based on their needs.

In the hotel apps, you can read and write the resources available in [Hotel Web Portal]() such as booking a room, viewing reviews and comments, writing a review, checking the beach report near the specific hotel and so on.

All APIs under the Hotel API are based on REST API and are accessible via HTTPS at specific URLs. The URL is different according to the endpoint of the resource being accessed. As an example, you can list all hotels via a GET request to this URL: `https://api.hotel.es/hotels`.

You can send test request and view responses in Postman in which you can also view the code for the request in various languages such as Python, Java, Javascript and more.
