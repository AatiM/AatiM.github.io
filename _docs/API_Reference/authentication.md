# Authentication
The Hotel API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in [the Hotel Dashboard]().
<br>

You might need to have access token in some requests. Your access token authorizes you to use the Hotel API server.
<br>

There are a few ways to get a token but you can use Postman and a cURL command to get one.
